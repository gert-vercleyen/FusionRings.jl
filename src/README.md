These are the source files for the package.
They contain the following content

* Creation.jl : Code that defines a type FusionRing and that constructs fusion rings of various kinds.
* FusionRings.jl : Main file. At the moment it contains only the essentials. Keep as simple as possible.
* Operations.jl: Code to manipulate fusion rings.
* Properties.jl: Code that queries and/or calculates properties of fusion rings

Some missing files:

* FusionRingList.jl: At some point we want to have a list of all rings from Anyonica in julia format
