These are files from anyonica that are useful for developing the julia package in the following sense:

* They contain usage messages for the functions
* If you're stuck on how to implement a function, you could take a look at how I did it

Note:

* My implementations are not always optimal nor elegant. The implementations were written to be just good enough to allow me to use them without getting annoyed with performance.
* Some function names in the Mathematica code differ from the ones in julia. The ones in julia are preferred.
